In this project contains the implementation of a diabetes prediction project. The key components include:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Data is loaded, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various visualizations and statistical summaries of the data.
3. **Model Training:** Logistic regression is used to train a model on the dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics, including a confusion matrix, are calculated to assess the model.

# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict diabetes using a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) on a medical dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical parameters.
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Tools and Libraries:**
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Files

- **`Diabetes_project.ipynb`:** The Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
  
## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the notebook in Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Diabeties_project.ipynb
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various medical parameters of patients such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin levels
- BMI
- Age

**Target:** Whether the patient has diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Load and inspect the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize the data using graphs and summary statistics.
4. **Model Training:** Train a logistic regression model to predict diabetes.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Use confusion matrix and accuracy to evaluate the model's performance.

## Visualizations

Key visualizations include:
- Correlation heatmap
- Pair plot
- Confusion matrix

## Conclusion

The model can predict diabetes with a good level of accuracy, as demonstrated by the evaluation metrics.
